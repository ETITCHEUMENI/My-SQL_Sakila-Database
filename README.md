# SQL Process:
  
When you are executing an SQL command for any RDBMS, the system determines the best way to carry out your
request and SQL engine figures out how to interpret the task.
There are various components included in the process. These components are Query Dispatcher, Optimization
Engines, Classic Query Engine and SQL Query Engine, etc. 
Classic query engine handles all non-SQL queries, but SQL query engine won't handle logical files.

 -> Following is a simple diagram showing SQL Architecture:
